# Cancer-Classification-using-Neural-Network

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be used for cancer classification by training it on a dataset of cancer patients with labeled information such as tumor size, stage, and type. The network will use this information to identify patterns and features that are indicative of different types of cancer. The input layer of the ANN will take in the patient data, while the hidden layers will perform calculations and identify patterns. The output layer will produce a classification for each patient, indicating the type of cancer they have. The accuracy of the classification model can be improved by optimizing the number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, activation function, and learning rate. The performance of the ANN can also be enhanced by using pre-processing techniques such as feature scaling and normalization. Overall, ANN can be a powerful tool in cancer classification when trained and optimized correctly.
